	<li>Africa</li>
	<img src="images/africa.jfif" alt="africa_maps">
	<p class="africa_content">Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent,after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km<sup>2</sup> (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands,it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and &frac15; of its land area.With 1.3 billion people as of 2018,it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents,Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita, in part due to geographic impediments,legacies of European colonization in Africa and the Cold War,Africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the human species originating from the continent.During the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century,anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago.

	<li>Asia</li>
	<img src="images/asia.png" alt="asia_map">
	<p class="asia_content">Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area.The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.

	<li>Australia</li>
	<img src="images/Australia.png" alt="australia_map">
	<p class="Austrailia_content" >Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.
Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day.</p>
	<li>Europe</li>
	<img src="images/Europe.png"  alt="Europe_map">
	<p class="europe_content">Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.Although some of this border is over land, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition.Europe covers about 10,180,000 km<sup>2 </sup>(3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second smallest continent. Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population.</p>
	<li>North America</li>
	<img  src="images/north_america.png" alt="north america">
	<p class="north_content">North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be described as a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean.

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the Earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third-largest continent by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably around the Caribbean) are included.North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period, via crossing the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period). The classic stage spans roughly the 6<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> centuries</p>
	<li>South America</li>
	<img  src="images/south_america.png"  alt="south_america">
	<p class="south_content">South America is a continent in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as a southern subcontinent of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).additional citation needed

It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; one overseas department and region of France: French Guiana; and one British Overseas Territory: the Falkland Islands. In addition, the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (a British Overseas Territory), and Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered part of South America.</p>
